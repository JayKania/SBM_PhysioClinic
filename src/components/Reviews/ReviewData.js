      "Shree Bharatimaiya Physiotherapy center is an excellent in terms of infrastructure, space and specially staff behavior towards patient. There is quite good space where exercise and machine physio have separate space. There are lot of machines available for physio. Individual doctor is looking after individual patients.I am very much impressed. I had serious backache and was continued for last 4-5 months. I had taken physio from other centers but no relief. But here I got relief within 15-20 days. Now I am alright and practicing exercise at home. I specially thanks to Dr. Sakshi Agrawal who was looking after me personally and I saw, she is very sincere and dedicated towards work. Her behavior and approach towards patient is fantastic. I wish her very good success and carrier ahead.",
